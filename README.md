# asciidoc-site-generator

This project is a static website generator using AsciiDoc files and Handlebars templates.

There is also the project
[asciidoc-with-gh-pages-action](https://github.com/brettaufheber/asciidoc-with-gh-pages-action#readme)
to use this static website generator as a GitHub Action to deploy a website using GitHub Pages.

## Installation

Install asciidoc-site-generator with npm:

```sh
npm install --save asciidoc-site-generator
```

## Usage

The generated output can be deployed either into a directory or to a Git repository.
Each of the two use cases has its own command.

The configuration for the generator can be passed by parameters or by environment variables.
For a complete list of parameters and environment variables, display the help view for each instruction.

Deploy a static website into a directory

```sh
node /path/to/generator build -h # shows how to use the command

node /path/to/generator build \
  --resources-paths ./path-to-project \
  --pages-path ./output-directory
```

Deploy a static website with version control

```sh
node /path/to/generator build-and-publish -h # shows how to use the command

node /path/to/generator build-and-publish \
  --resources-paths ./path-to-project \
  --branch my-output-branch \
  --remote-url my-repo-url \
  --user "My Name <email@domain.tld>"
```

The remote URL parameter is not required if this application is running inside the root directory of a Git project and
will be determined automatically in this case.

The user parameter is only required if neither a user is configured globally nor is configured in the current working
directory.

## The file structure of a project

Each resource directory processed by the generator can contain the following directories and files.

* **/static/** - All files in this directory are copied directly to the output.
* **/documents/** - The AsciiDoc (.adoc) files which will be converted into HTML files.
* **/stylesheets/** - CSS files or SCSS, Sass, Less files which need to be compiled.
* **/collections/** - Some YAML and JSON files providing data available for templating.
* **/templates/** - The [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) template files.
  In order to allow maximum flexibility for web development, the generated HTML content is passed to Handlebars
  templates, allowing for a complete separation of content and web design.
  This static website generator comes with
  some [basic Handlebars helpers](https://github.com/brettaufheber/basic-handlebars-helpers#readme).
* **/dependencies.json** - An optional file which lists some packages automatically deployed to the output.
  The notation used for the [dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies) is
  the same as for a package.json file. An example file can be
  viewed [here](https://github.com/brettaufheber/asciidoc-site-generator/blob/main/test/theme/dependencies.json).

It is recommended to spread the structure across several resource directories.
This makes it possible to separate files into web content, theme and translations, for example.

## Example project

To simplify the first steps with the static website generator, an example can be used.

The example project has two resource directories:

* [Web content](https://github.com/brettaufheber/asciidoc-site-generator/tree/main/test/content)
* [Theme](https://github.com/brettaufheber/asciidoc-site-generator/tree/main/test/theme)

Build the example project

```sh
node . build -i "./test/content,./test/theme" -o "pages"
```
